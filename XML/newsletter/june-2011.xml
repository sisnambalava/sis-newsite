&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forthcoming Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The next Monthly Meeting will be held on Sunday the 12th of June between 1-4 p.m. at Saiva Munnetra Sangam No.2 Salisbury Road, Manor Park, E12 6AB.  Mr. Balasubramanian will be leading a Sampradhaya Bhajanai.  It would be a splendid satsangam and we assure you a very divine atmosphere in Sri Natarajar temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the grand success of the SIS Cricket at Event last year, we have scheduled to hold this year's cricket event on the Saturday 9th of July at Recreation Ground, Pinner Road, harrow, Middlesex, HA1 1PB.  We are planning to have league matches between three teams, to decide the winning team. We are getting great response for this year as well.  In order to organise well and plan better, we request you to send in your participation and your area of expertise in cricket (could be bowling, batting, wicket keeping, umpiring or all of them) as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are organising a upanyasam in August by a learned scholar who is trained to perform upanyasam in Sri Anantharama Dikshadar style. Details to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please block your calendar for all SIS events. Details of all the events are available under the Events Section on the website.  As we update them with details of events as and when they are finalised, please keep visiting the Nambalava website.  Members are requested to attend these meetings and send in their much valued feedback and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;As you may have already noticed, we are taking all possible efforts to provide interesting and useful articles on the website &lt;a href="http://www.sisnambalava.org.uk" target="_blank"&gt;www.sisnambalava.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; We are encouraged by the number of visits on our website globally, which is only increasing multi-fold every month. This month, we have uploaded interesting articles about Vaikasi Visakam with some wonderful photographs of temples, some articles to kindle your thought like "Why me?", "Where there is a will, there is a way" etc. Please visit the website, read the articles and let us know your views.  We also welcome articles from all our members.  The articles will be uploaded after review by the editorial panel.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success of Charity Drive so far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;As you are aware, SIS committee initiated a charity drive to support Raja Veda Patasala in Kumbakonam, one of the oldest Veda Patasalas in India dating back to 1542. We are extremely pleased that we  have collected over £600 so far. We have set ourselves an aggressive target of £5000/- for this year. We are committed to this cause and wish to assure you that the entire proceeds from this charity drive will be donated to the Veda Patasala once the target is achieved, or at least when the amount collected is close to the target,  so that they could use this as corpus amount and get return from this for their expenses. We will keep you informed periodically.   The Committee requests you all to donate generously to this noble cause.  You can easily transfer the money as a lump sum to be added to the corpus amount or set up standing order through your bank to the following SIS account: &lt;/p&gt;

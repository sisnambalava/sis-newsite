  <Maindescription>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Less than three weeks remaining for the Olympic torch to complete its journey to Olympics venue at Stratford.  The Olympic committee is busy doing its final preparations for holding a safe event.  London is waiting to create so many new records.  For those who were lucky enough to get tickets, we are confident you will enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was a very hectic one for SIS as well (not as busy as the Olympics organising committee though).  We had the annual SIS Cricket Galatta on Saturday and SIS July Satsang on Sunday.  We take this opportunity to thank everyone who could make it for the event(s) and we are confident that you thoroughly enjoyed, despite the uncertain British weather.  Photographs of the SIS Cricket Galatta are available on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Tamil calendar, we will be entering into Dhakshinayana Punyakalam (Aadi month) on the 16th July.  1st day of Aadi is also celebrated as Aadi Pandigai.  More information to follow in the next few weeks on the Sama Upakarma which is on the 24th of July, Varalakshmi Nonbu which falls on the 27th July, Yajur Upakarma on the 1st August and Rig Upakarma on the 2nd August. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;Contributing back to the society while having fun!&lt;/span&gt; How does it sound? Very interesting isn’t it? Yes. SIS will be holding a carnival where we are planning to have number of food stalls, mehandi stall, jewellery stalls, books, paintings, face painting, games and many more….. We guarantee that, it will be a perfect day out on a beautiful August afternoon where we as SIS family with our friends can contribute something back to the society while having food and fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an initiative with an intention to donate money to Shooting Star Children’s Hospice &lt;a href="http://www.www.shootingstarchase.org.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;www.shootingstarchase.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; and Great Ormond Street Hospital &lt;a href="http://www.gosh.org/" target="_blank"&gt;www.gosh.org&lt;/a&gt;.

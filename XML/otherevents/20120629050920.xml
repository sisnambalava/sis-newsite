&lt;p&gt;The main item of the programme ie Chariot Festival ( Ther Thiruvizha )
- outside procession is taking place on SUNDAY 8th
July 10am to 2pm.The chief priest Rajasekara Gurrukal has specially
requested our bhajan group to conduct bhajan for these 4 hours inspite
of my answer 2 hours from 10am to 12pm. So we have agreed to do this -
with Lord's blessings we hope to carry out this task to the best of
our ability.&lt;/p&gt;

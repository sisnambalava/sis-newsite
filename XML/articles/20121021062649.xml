  <Maindescription>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Ma Katyayini is worshipped on the sixth day of Navarathri. Devi took the human form as daughter of Sage Katyayan, pleased with his hard penance. The Goddess with trinethra and seated on Simha vahanam is an Ashtabhuja Durga. Motehr holds sword in one hand and a lotus in another. She shows abhaya mudra with one hand protecting us from difficulties and troubles we face in our lives and varadha mudra with her other hand showering boons on us. Katyayini is the force behind the mental power that controls life and death. Yogis and Sadhaks practice penance for Agya chakra on this day.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Shree Katyayini Peeth is located at Vrindavan. Tufts and hair locks of Sati Devi fell at Brij and this became one of the Shakti Sthalams and called Katyayini Peeth. Legends say that Gopis prayed to Goddess Katyayani to attain Lord Krishna as their beloved. &lt;/p&gt;

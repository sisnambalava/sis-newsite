  <Maindescription>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Nine year old Gorak Rajesh is clearing the boards as he prepares to take on his greatest challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much travelled Chelmsford chess prodigy has been invited to represent England in under-10 section of the World Youth Championships in Brazil in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gorak has also been chosen to join the under-10s England Squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian-born Gorak, who attends St. Anne’s School became one of the youngest chess champions in the country at five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gorak Rajesh Titles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He beat players four years older than himself to take the under-9’s boy’s title in the Norfolk Junior Chess Championships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gorak said: “I love chess, but I also like football, rugby, swimming and I read a lot and I like writing poetry”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proud father Rajesh Nagarjunan said, “While teaching my wife Jayashree to play chess in Singapore, Gorak, who was only three would try to join in and he picked-it-up so. We signed him up for lessons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can assure you we have not pushed him to play competitively but he can’t wait to go to Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
